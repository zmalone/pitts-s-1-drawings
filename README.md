# Pitts S-1S Drawings
CAD Drawings of S-1S brackets and sheet metal.  All files are currently in .dxf format, and should be usable by anyone with a CNC table.  I've had wood parts cut on a router table, and metal cut via water jet.

Buyer beware, please double check all measurements before you pay someone to cut these.

## Notes
These brackets have bend relief allowances.  These are not called for in the plans, please adjust them if you don't want them:
* 210-85/86
* 210-87/88
* 210-89/90
* 210-96
* 210-106/107
* 210-108/109
* 210-110/111

Some parts are duplicated in different directions, such as 224-29/224-30.  I've included the first part number, but not both numbers.
