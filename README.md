# Pitts S-1S Drawings
CAD Drawings of S-1S brackets and sheet metal.  All files are currently in .dxf format, and should be usable by anyone with a CNC table.  I've had wood parts cut on a router table, and metal cut via water jet.

## TODO
I'm planning on using someone else's tail and wing kit.  No tail or wing brackets are included at this time.

I have not yet drawn the lower engine cowling.
