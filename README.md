# Pitts S-1S Drawings
CAD Drawings of S-1S brackets and sheet metal.  All files are currently in .dxf format, and should be usable by anyone with a CNC table.  I've had wood parts cut on a router table, and metal cut via water jet.

Buyer beware, please double check all measurements before you pay someone to cut these.

Please do not add plans with proprietary information to this collection.  Everything in this collection is useful for building a Pitts from plans, but the goal is not to copy anyone's secret sauce.

## Notes
These brackets have bend relief allowances and bend notches.  These are not called for in the plans, but I was okay with them being subsumed into the weld, please adjust them if you don't want them:
* 210-85/86
* 210-87/88
* 210-89/90
* 210-96
* 210-106/107
* 210-108/109
* 210-110/111

Some parts are duplicated in different directions, such as 224-29/224-30.  I've included the first part number, but not both numbers.

## TODO
Add material and count information for each part.

I'm planning on using someone else's tail and wing kit.  No tail or wing brackets are included at this time.
